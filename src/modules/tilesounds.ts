/**
 * The footstep sounds set on tiles in the map editor (USER REQUEST 2026-10-19: "a separate tab that allows selecting
 * multiple tiles to share a sound (picked from asset server)").
 *
 * A map keeps its tilesets inside its own file, so a sound written into one map's tileset would reach no other map
 * that draws the same picture, and the map generator writes its own sounds into its maps on every build. The editor's
 * sounds are kept apart instead, in one list for every map: <assets>/tilesounds.json, by tileset picture (the image's
 * file name without its extension, in lower case: "environment") and tile (its id in that tileset). The game client
 * lays the list over the `footstep_sound` tile properties of the map it is on: a tile in the list sounds as the list
 * says, "" being no sound at all; any other tile keeps its map's own.
